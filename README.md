# NAIN: Real-Time Object Detection and Navigation Assistance for the Visually Impaired

NAIN is a web-based application that provides real-time object detection and navigation assistance for individuals who are visually impaired or blind. It leverages computer vision techniques, such as the Single Shot Detector (SSD) model, to detect objects in the surroundings and provide audio-based guidance and feedback to the user.
